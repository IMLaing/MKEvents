	<h1 class="text-center">The different an Event Coordinator and an Event Planner can make</h1>
	<br>

	<img src="http://exgirlfriendrecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dollarphotoclub_71097218-copy-820x450.jpg" alt="Confused Man - MK Events" class="leftBlogImg"><p>There are a lot of words thrown around in different industries that can be misinterpreted or interpreted in unclear ways depending on who you speak to.  Our name – Uniquely MK Events, has the term ‘Event’ in it. Sounds a bit scary, huh? But really, an event can be anything where people come together for a common reason or purpose for a good time! Birthday parties, holiday parties, graduation parties, a birthday, a wedding, a housewarming, a going away party – they are all events and just as special as the next!</p>
 
	<p>One of the biggest misconceptions we hear is the difference between a coordinator and a planner, furthermore – which you need and why.</p>
 
	<p>Simply speaking, a planner makes decisions regarding what, when, who, and how. A coordinator on the other hand, makes sure all of the details and planning are executed correctly, and that each vendor (when applicable) shows up on time and performs properly.</p>
 
	<p>Here are our top 5 reasons why you should hire a planner or a coordinator:</p>
		 
		<h2>Top 5 Reasons to Hire an Event Planner: </h2>
	<br>

 	<div class="row">
	 	<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
			<ol>
				<li> You are New to the Area:
		Hiring a planner when you don’t know the area or can’t be in the area to look at venues or vendors is a great idea. You have someone knowledgeable and able to weed through the good and the bad.</li>
				<li> When you Have no Idea How or Where to Begin:
		Know you are throwing a party? Great! Now what? That’s where we come in. Planners don’t have to do it all. They can simply help you create a list and point you in the right direction so you don’t feel as lost.</li>
				<li> You’ll Save Time:
		Having a planner with an arsenal of vendors and ideas will eliminate hours of googling just to find a few people to reach out to.</li>
				<li> You’ll Save Money:
		Planners know what is worth your money, what isn’t, and how to cut corners to stay within your budget yet still have an amazing party.</li>
				<li> You Have Someone to Always Talk to:
		It’s their job!  You don’t have to feel bad about “annoying” one of your friends or family members with dozens of questions.</li>
		 	</ol>

			<ol>
				<li>You can Breathe, Eat, Drink
				You won’t be bogged down taking out the trash, refilling food and drinks or showing your guests where the bathroom is. The coordinator’s got it covered and you’ll be able to enjoy your party!</li>
				<li>Solves any Unexpected Problem
				If something goes wrong they will fix it before you even realize it, ensuring the party continues to go as planned</li>
				<li> You Save Time:
				No need to get all the set up done before you get ready, the coordinator will help you set up so you’re not wasting an entire day with party preparation</li>
				<li> You have Someone you can Trust:
				If you’re event is a wedding with dozens of other vendors – having a coordinator who knows you that you can trust is a big relief. When you’re getting ready and having fun, you can rest assured things will go the way you want them to, vendors are arriving on time, things are going where you want them, etc.</li>
				<li> You will Stay Organized:
				Depending on the size of your event the coordination can start up to a month in advance. The coordinator will help you stay on track with payments or bills, and anything else you may need leading up to your big day.</li>
