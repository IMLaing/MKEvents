				<h3 class="popTextLeft col-md-4">"I really didn't want to have to worry about set-up, making sure everyone was where they were supposed to be"</h3>
				<p class="testimonialText col-md-8">"I hired Marisa when she worked for Laurel Events as a "day of coordinator" for my wedding a few years ago. Marissa was fabulous! She put my entire wedding into a timeline making sure that no details were missed. She reached out to all of my vendors and made sure everyone was on the same page. She offered advise and recommendations throughout the whole process. I really didn't want to have to worry about set-up, making sure everyone was where they were supposed to be on the day of the wedding and all of this was handled by Marisa. I didn't have to worry about a thing on my wedding day! I was able to just enjoy the day and get ready with my bridal party, I didn't have to answer 1 phone call! I also hired Marisa for the rehearsal which I was really happy about because that way she made sure that the ceremony was perfect as well. All in all Marisa did an amazing job, I wish I could hire her as a day of coordinator every day! She made the whole day stress free for me, I would definitely recommend her to any bride's- to- be out there!"<br> - Emily Curtis Pott</p>
