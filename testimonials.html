		<div class="testimonialContainerhalf">
		<p>"I hired Marisa when she worked for Laurel Events as a "day of coordinator" for my wedding a few years ago. Marissa was fabulous! She put my entire wedding into a timeline making sure that no details were missed. She reached out to all of my vendors and made sure everyone was on the same page. She offered advise and recommendations throughout the whole process. I really didn't want to have to worry about set-up, making sure everyone was where they were supposed to be on the day of the wedding and all of this was handled by Marisa. I didn't have to worry about a thing on my wedding day! I was able to just enjoy the day and get ready with my bridal party, I didn't have to answer 1 phone call! I also hired Marisa for the rehearsal which I was really happy about because that way she made sure that the ceremony was perfect as well. All in all Marisa did an amazing job, I wish I could hire her as a day of coordinator every day! She made the whole day stress free for me, I would definitely recommend her to any bride's- to- be out there!"</p><p> - Emily Curtis Pott</p>

			<p>"Thank you for your service. You were very helpful and many of my guests were very impressed! Only problem is I ended up with too many leftovers because you did such a great job cleaning for me! We will definitley be hiring you again for our next party" </p>

		<div class="testimonialContainer">
			<p>"Marisa did an excellent job keeping everything filled, cleaned, replished and running smoothly - freeing me up to enjoy the party! She was both unobtrusive and proactive. Would definitley recommend" </p>
			<p>- Elizabeth Moulds</p>

		<div class="testimonialContainer">
			<p>"Marisa is amazing! We've worked with so many event planners (10+) over the past year and she was on the ball. She knew her goals right away and is a natural event planner. I would not hesitate to hire her again and again and again. Trust me, you want her on your team for a successful event!"  </p>

			<p>"Marisa was my right hand during my ownership of Laurel Events (an award winning wedding planning business serving New England and beyond). Her work ethic is phenomenal, her timeliness and organization is beyond impressive, and her passion for the business and her clients cannot be beat. Weddings are stressful and timely and she is the woman you want by your side to stay cool and manage all that unfolds. Weddings are over before you blink and every minute will be enjoyed with Marisa on your side."</p>

			<p>“From our first conversation months before my wedding until the day after the wedding Marisa was not only super responsive but sweet and professional. She helped my day go perfectly and I can’t imagine using anyone else! They are sweet, genuine people and that’s exactly the type of people I wanted around me for my day”  </p>
